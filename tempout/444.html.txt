microrobots
one
of
the
goals
of
the
microrobotics
group
of
the
mit
artificial
intelligence
laboratory
is
to
develop
new
techniques
for
the
construction
of
miniature
mobile
robots
in
addition
to
building
cool
little
robots
we
also
are
exploring
different
ways
to
take
advantage
of
their
size
for
useful
and
interesting
applications
current
projects
the
ants
microrobots
designed
to
explore
ideas
about
robotic
communities
one
of
the
potential
applications
for
this
research
is
explosive
ordnance
disposal
bf
skinny
a
cubic
inch
robot
designed
to
compete
in
the
international
microrobot
maze
competition
the
rockettes
the
goal
of
the
rockettes
project
is
to
build
small
gram
mobile
robots
for
planetary
exploration
that
way
we
can
send
many
microrobots
instead
of
a
single
larger
