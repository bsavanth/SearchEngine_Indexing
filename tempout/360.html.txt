the
virtual
world
data
server
project
is
a
three
years
million
dollar
project
funded
under
the
nsf
hpcc
multidisciplinary
challenge
program
the
project
is
to
expand
d
interactive
simulations
and
virtual
world
models
to
disk
based
storage
today
virtually
all
such
systems
require
that
the
model
data
fit
in
main
memory
the
project
has
many
aspects
including
the
design
of
appropriate
storage
structures
real
time
delivery
of
model
data
in
response
to
user
actions
inclusion
of
quality
of
service
tradeoffs
into
resource
management
and
many
others
the
applications
to
be
explicitly
addressed
in
the
project
span
a
range
including
urban
simulation
models

and

virtual
aneursm
work
the
storage
server
will
be
designed
and
implemented
in
the
computer
science
department
and
will
serve
over
atm
lines
users
at
the
department
of
architecture
and
at
the
plasma
physics
lab
as
well
as
locally
for
the
aneurysm
research
aside
from
adapting
and
interfacing
the
above
existing
applications
to
the
storage
server
we
will
also
work
on
the
actual
design
of
the
storage
server
and
integration
of
the
auxiliary
databases
with
respect
to
the
integration
of
spatial
databases
we
will
be
exploring
novel
uses
of
the
d
interactive
capability
both
as
a
query
mechanism
and
as
a
form
of
presentation
of
responses

queries
