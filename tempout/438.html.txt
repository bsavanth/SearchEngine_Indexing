minimalist
robotics
uses
large
numbers
of
simple
inexpensive
robots
to
study
emergent
computation
in
systems
of
interacting
agents
at
indiana
university
we
are
using
the
hexapod
stiquito
robot
that
was
invented
here
in
to
create
a
stiquito
colony
a
new
project
involves
large
numbers
of
robot
bacteria
called
robozoa
to
study
field
computation
with
physical
agents
