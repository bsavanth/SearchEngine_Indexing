programming
is
in
general
the
art
of
solving
problems
the
study
of
computer
programming
is
therefore
the
study
of
solving
problems
with
a
computer
but
it
is
also
much
more
when
a
programmer
writes
a
program
he
or
she
is
actually
constructing
a
model
of
a
process
for
doing
something
such
a
model
is
called
an
algorithm
furthermore
the
programmer
is
concerned
not
only
with
whether
the
program
simply
works
but
also
with
how
well
it
works
and
how
it
interacts
with
both
users
and
other
programs
this
class
is
designed
mainly
to
teach
you
the
art
of
computer
programming
to
that
end
we
shall
try
to
develop
in
you
a
sense
of
style
and
aesthetics
that
will
help
guide
your
programming
efforts
and
we
shall
try
to
develop
your
intuition
about
how
things
work
and
why
you
will
learn
some
of
the
design
principles
that
go
into
the
engineering
of
good
programs
we
shall
teach
you
a
little
computer
science
to
give
you
a
way
of
analyzing
your
programs
and
your
algorithms
and
finding
the
means
to
improve
them
you
will
learn
a
number
of
standard
algorithms
and
some
programming
idioms
standard
ways
of
performing
certain
kinds
of
tasks
to
do
any
programming
we
need
to
choose
a
language
whichever
we
choose
the
language
does
not
place
limits
on
what
our
programs
can
do
but
only
on
what
they
look
like
it
provides
us
with
a
framework
in
which
to
organize
our
ideas
about
processes
and
problem
solving
the
programming
language
we
use
in
this
class
is
scheme
we
have
chosen
it
because
it
provides
a
convenient
mechanism
for
describing
most
of
the
idioms
and
processes
that
programmers
have
found
useful
we
won
t
spend
much
time
teaching
the
details
of
the
language
because
we
don
t
have
to
you
will
find
that
it
is
easy
to
pick
up
as
we
go
along
it
is
often
helpful
to
first
program
using
a
simple
powerful
language
like
scheme
even
if
one
must
then
translate
the
solution
into
a
more
traditional
programming
language
like
c
the
simplicity
of
scheme
allows
us
to
treat
many
computer
science
topics
in
more
depth
than
would
be
possible
if
c
or
c
were
used
for
in
traditional
languages
more
inessential
detail
must
be
mastered
scheme
allows
us
to
give
a
better
impression
of
the
true
joys
and
challenges
of
programming
then
you
will
be
in
a
better
position
to
study
c
in
your
next
computer
science
course
c212
finally
computer
programming
is
still
a
fairly
young
field
and
it
hasn
t
lost
its
sense
of
fun
for
lots
of
people
including
us
we
hope
that
you
will
enjoy
it
as
much
as
we
do
goals
at
the
end
of
the
course
a
student
can
be
expected
to
know
the
following
concepts
and
to
be
able
to
write
good
scheme
programs
the
students
should
be
able
to
use
the
following
data
types
symbols
numbers
booleans
lists
vectors
and
matrices
strings
and
characters
the
students
should
know
how
to
write
programs
in
recursive
iterative
and
imperative
styles
students
should
be
able
to
write
recursive
programs
on
lists
both
those
containing
only
top
level
items
and
those
containing
nested
sublists
tree
recursion
the
students
should
be
able
to
use
procedures
as
first
class
objects
that
is
pass
them
as
arguments
and
also
write
programs
whose
values
are
procedures
this
includes
the
currying
and
composing
of
procedures
the
students
should
understand
the
concept
of
scope
and
environment
they
should
be
able
to
use
locally
defined
procedures
students
should
be
able
to
use
abstraction
both
with
data
in
making
programs
independent
of
the
data
representation
and
also
with
procedures
in
abstracting
the
structure
of
programs
students
should
be
able
to
use
the
input
and
output
routines
and
write
convenient
user
interfaces
for
their
programs
students
should
be
able
to
handle
the
binary
representation
of
numbers
students
should
know
some
of
the
standard
sorting
routines
e
g
insertion
sort
o
n
mergesort
and
quicksort
o
n
log
n
and
understand
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
each
they
should
also
be
able
to
write
both
linear
and
binary
search
programs
students
should
know
how
to
mutate
various
data
structures
including
lists
vectors
strings
in
addition
they
should
understand
side
effecting
variables
students
should
be
able
to
read
programs
and
have
an
appreciation
of
what
constitutes
good
programming
style
they
should
be
aware
of
the
relative
efficiency
of
programs
certain
topics
will
be
included
if
time
permits
these
include
such
things
as
writing
and
using
syntactic
extensions
developing
an
object
oriented
programming
package
in
scheme
and
using
streams
literate
programming
every
programmer
knows
that
programs
must
be
comprehensible
to
the
computer
the
programming
language
implementation
complains
when
they
are
not
but
with
some
practice
it
is
generally
easy
to
solve
such
problems
what
is
less
appreciated
is
that
programs
must
also
be
comprehensible
to
the
programmer
otherwise
the
programmer
cannot
have
any
confidence
that
the
program
is
correct
a
program
may
easily
be
comprehensible
to
the
computer
but
not
do
what
is
intended
and
only
the
programmer
knows
what
is
intended
in
most
cases
it
is
also
essential
that
programs
be
comprehensible
to
other
programmers
though
this
is
not
typical
of
student
programming
experience
in
the
real
world
programmers
spend
most
of
their
time
modifying
huge
programs
that
were
developed
over
a
long
period
of
time
by
many
other
programmers
modifying
someone
else
s
code
or
even
your
own
a
few
months
later
may
be
a
joy
or
a
nightmare
depending
on
how
clearly
the
program
is
written
thus
we
emphasize
the
importance
literate
programming
writting
programs
that
are
easy
to
understand
relative
to
the
difficulty
of
the
problem
they
solve
literate
programming
is
almost
always
more
important
than
other
programming
goals
such
as
efficiency
and
code
compactness
though
efficiency
and
compactness
are
often
byproducts
of
literate

as

all

it
is
recommended
that
you
use
the
ucs
university
computing
services
machines
named
copper
and
zinc
new
students
should
have
a
network
id
and
instructions
for
creating
copper
and
zinc
accounts
as
soon
as
you
have
your
account
you
should
configure
it
to
run
emacs
scheme
within
emacs
and
the
handin
program
this
is
done
by
entering
c211
setup
hitting
return
and
logging
out
you
only
have
to
do
this
once
when
you
login
the
next
time
your
account
will
be
configured
for
c211
you
have
to
configure
both
your
copper
and
zinc
accounts
assignments
will
be
posted
on
or
before
wednesday
afternoon
and
will
be
due
electronically
by
p
m
on
the
wednesday
of
the
following
week
any
written
material
will
be
due
at
the
beginning
of
the
lecture
on
that
thursday
or
friday
late
assignments
will
not
be
accepted
in
computing
the
semester
assignment
average
the
lowest
assignment
grade
will
be
dropped
although
assignments
count
for
only
of
the
final
grade
it
is
essential
that
you
do
the
assignments
to
master
the
material
computer
programming
like
playing
a
musical
instrument
can
only
be
mastered
through
lots
of
practice
programming
assignments
are
submitted
using
the
program
c211
handin
in
the
directory
c211
bin
on
copper
and
zinc
the
handin
program
evaluates
and
grades
your
program
s
behavior
and
the
results
are
returned
to
you
almost
immediately
via
email
since
zinc
allows
e
mail
to
be
sent
but
not
received
you
will
have
to
read
the
grading
results
on
the
machine
where
you
normally
read
your
mail
you
may
correct
and
resubmit
your
programs
as
many
as
five
times
until
the
announced
deadline
the
highest
grade
recorded
for
the
assignment
will
be
the
one
that
is
entered
into
the
class
gradebook
in
this
course
you
may
discuss
assignments
with
other
students
do
not
assume
this
is
true
in
all
your
courses
we
expect
you
to
actually
think
through
and
fully
understand
assignment
solutions
we
have
found
that
students
who
copy
someone
elses
work
and
turn
in
something
they
do
not
fully
understand
usually
fail
the
examinations
and
the
added
by
having
good
assignment
grades
is
insufficient
to
pass
the
course
teamwork
in
doing
assignments
is
good
as
long
as
each
member
of
the
team
contributes
and
fully
understands
the
programs
this
certainly
means
that
you
should
not
put
your
name
on
a
file
written
by
someone
else
and
submit
it
as
your
own
work
after
the
final
submission
of
an
assignment
it
will
not
only
be
electronically
graded
but
an
associate
instructor
will
also
grade
the
assignment
for
style
good
programming
style
makes
it
easier
to
get
your
programs
working
and
also
develops
the
habit
of
literate
programming
which
as
we
have
already
noted
is
of
great
importance
in
developing
large
programs
in
this
course
good
style
is
also
rewarded
in
the
evaluation
of
exams
for
scheme
programming
consistent
use
of
a
suitable
style
of
program
indentation
is
essential
and
violation
of
the
first
cardinal
rule
of
indentation
will
automaticaly
result
in
loss
of
credit
