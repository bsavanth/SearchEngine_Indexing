we
are
adapting
an

group
communication
tool
horus
to
multimedia
applications
such
secure
and
reliable
group
communication
primitives
are
critical
for
advanced
military
and
commercial

cmt
is
a
portable
toolkit
for
building
applications
that
include
audio
and
video
facilitating
the
rapid
prototyping
of
multimedia
applications
