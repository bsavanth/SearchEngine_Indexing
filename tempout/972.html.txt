and

the
official
syllabus
for
comp
students
who
have
not
taken
these
classes
or
similar
classes
taught
at
another
university
should
not
register
for
comp
despite
what
your
advisor
or
other
students
may
tell
you
there
may
be
some
students
who
have
not
taken
comp
or
comp
who
may
be
able
to
learn
the
material
covered
in
these
classes
on
their
own
before
the
fall
semester
begins
however
i
think
this
is
a
risky
course
of
action
for
most
people
another
note
comp
mentioned
in
the
previous
paragraph
is
the
quot
new
quot
comp
which
is
a
course
intended
for
undergraduates
before
last
year
comp
was
taught
as
a
senior
undergraduate
first
year
graduate
level
course
final
note
if
you
are
planning
to
take
this
course
then
i
suggest
that
you
read
the
first
chapters
of
the
textbook
before
the
semester
begins
i
plan
to
review
this
material
with
blazing
speed
if
you
ve
taken
the
prerequisite
then
reading
these
chapters
shouldn
t
pose
any
serious
problems
for
you
this
textbook
is
a
quick
read
latest
word
on
textbooks
i
m
told
that
there
are
copies
at
the
bookstore
with
more
on
backorder
why
they
ve
ordered
more
is
a
mystery
to
me
maybe
it
s
because
is
using
the
same
book
the
edition
is
the
same
as
last
year
the
edition
i
had
heard
a
new
edition
is
coming
out
this
year
but
i
guess
it
isn
t
ready
yet
