a

can
be
found
at
the
latter
portion
of
this

gradually
abstracts
of
these
publications
will
be

work
raw
data

appropriate
for
an

a

of
current
online

or

are
given
first
online
reports
and

in
many
cases
technical
reports
and
electronic
addenda
of
published
work
will
be
placed
on

here
in
both
postscript

format
though
not
necessarily
at
the
same
time
your
comments
are
welcome
in
certain
of
these
cases
should
you
email
comments
regarding
related
literature
suggestions
for
experimental
or
theoretical
improvements
alternative
viewpoints
then
your
comments
if
reasonable
and
informative
they
will
be
linked
to
the
html
version
of
the
technical
report
or
addendum
and
under
a
separate
list
of
comments
unless
you
state
that
you
do
not
want
this
to
be
done
i
may
also
link
responses
to
your
comments
but
not
before
getting
your
feedback
on
a
response
comments
on
purely
style
issues
are
welcome
but
they
probably
will
not
be
linked
in
others
who
view
the
technical
report
will
be
free
to
view
your
comments
as
well
if
your
comments
inform
a
revision
of
the
report
e
g
for
publication
then
i
will
acknowledge
them
as
a
personal
communication
or
otherwise
cite
the
literature
that
you
relate
if
i
deem
it
relevant
if
your
comments
are
online
and
linked
to
a
report
then
you
agree
to
allow
others
to
cite
them
as
personal

as
