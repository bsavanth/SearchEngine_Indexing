high

design
methodologies

optimal
systems
abstract
since
most
time
and
memory
critical
parts
of
scientific
computing
applications
are
usually
concentrated
in
nested
loops
this
research
focuses
on
optimization
algorithms
for
synthesis
of
those
multi
level
loops
the
loop
nests
are
modeled
as
multi
dimensional
data
flow
graphs
mdfg
and
algorithms
taking
advantage
of
the
multi
dimensionality
are
designed
computation
of
a
nested
loop
can
be
visualized
as
the
repeated
executions
of
the
iteration
body
in
a
multi
dimensional
iteration
space
by
considering
the
iteration
space
and
the
iteration
body
simultaneously
the
proposed
transformation
and
optimization
techniques
will
be
able
to
optimize
throughput
and
memory
requirement
at
the
behavior
level
the
proposed
project
will
develop
polynomial
time
algorithms
on
various
graph
models
rather
than
using
traditional
integer
linear
programming
approaches
research
topics
of
this
project
include
graph
transformation
and
optimization
techniques
using
the
concept
of
multi
dimensional
interleaving
and
retiming
to
obtain
optimal
throughput
with
the
minimal
increase
of
memory
requirement
