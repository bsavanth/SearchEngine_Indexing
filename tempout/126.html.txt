this
www
page
describes
work
in
pattern
separation
via
linear
programming
in
the
mathematical
programming
section
of
the
university
of
wisconsin
madison
computer
sciences
department
brief
history
and
method
outline
mathematical
optimization
approaches
in
particular
linear
programming
have
long
been
used
in
problems
of
pattern
separation
in
linear
programs
were
used
to
construct
planes
to
separate
linearly
separable
point
sets
separation
by
a
nonlinear
surface
using
linear
programming
was
also
described
whenever
the
surface
parameters
appeared
linearly
e
g
a
quadratic
or
polynomial
surface
these
formulations
however
could
fail
on
sets
that
were
not
separable
by
a
surface
linear
in
its
parameters
a
multisurface
method
msm
avoided
this
difficulty
msm
separates
disjoint
finite
point
sets
in
n
dimensional
euclidean
space
as
follows
choose
parallel
planes
in
n
dimensional
euclidean
space
as
close
together
so
that
only
the
region
between
the
two
planes
contains
points
from
both
sets
i
e
the
regions
not
between
the
parallel
planes
contain
only
points
of
set
or
no
points
discard
the
points
in
the
regions
not
between
the
parallel
planes
repeat
the
process
on
the
points
between
the
parallel
planes
until
the
region
between
the
parallel
planes
contains
no
points
or
very
few
points
multisurface
method
tree
msm
t
a
variant
on
the
multisurface
method
was
developed
in
a
b
let
a
and
b
be
finite
disjoint
point
sets
in
n
dimensional
euclidean
space
the
goal
of
msm
t
is
to
determine
a
sequence
of
planes
in
n
dimensional
euclidean
space
that
separate
the
sets
a
and
b
as
follows
determine
a
plane
in
n
dimensional
euclidean
space
that
minimizes
the
average
distances
of
misclassified
points
a
point
from
set
a
is
misclassified
if
it
lies
on
the
side
of
the
separating
plane
assigned
to
b
similarly
a
point
from
set
b
is
misclassified
if
it
lies
on
the
side
of
the
separating
plane
assigned
to
a
if
the
regions
assigned
to
a
and
b
contain
only
or
mostly
points
of
the
set
a
or
b
then
stop
otherwise
generate
another
error
minimizing
plane
in
in
this
region
the
sequence
of
planes
generated
can
be
viewed
as
a
decision
tree
for
each
node
in
the
tree
the
best
split
of
the
points
reaching
that
node
is
found
by
solving
the
lp
in
above
the
node
is
split
into
branches
and
the
same
procedure
is
applied
until
there
are
only
or
mostly
points
of
one
set
at
the
node
this
linear
programming
approach
can
also
be
viewed
as
training
a
neural
network
with
hidden
layer
see
msm
t
has
been
shown
to
learn
concepts
as
well
or
better
than
more
traditional
learning
methods
such
as
c4
and
cart
it
also
has
an
advantage
over
artificial
neural
network
ann
methods
such
as
backpropagation
in
that
training
proceeds
much
faster
