you
may

used

does
the

in

october

you
may
use
the
listitarator
class
for
the

as
long
as
it
results
in
a
time
efficient
procedure
as
without
it
time

respect

for

if
you
do

insert

results
in
very
inefficient
code
so
just
implement
the
operation
directly
remember
we
want
time
efficient
code
but
do
not
try
to
optimize
to
the

do
not

comments
on

project
the
root
node
in
both
figures
should
have
a
instead
of
an
october
pm
just
called
the
rbr
and
they
said
the
old
midterms
for
cs130a
are
there
if
they
are
not
listed
then
ask
the
person
in
the
counter
directly
october
pm
as
we
said
in
the
first
handout
you
must
work
in
the
project
and
homeworks
individually
as
i
said
before
in
the
project
my
member
functions
should
not
be
your
final
memeber
functions
the
purpose
of
the
functions
is
to
give
examples
on
how
to
acceess
the
data
however
the
data
in
the
nodes
should
be
left
untouched
in
the
project
handout
page
i
say
that
x
is
followed
by
a
cr
i
should
have
said
that
x
is
followed
by
a
cr
or
a
blank
the
same
holds
for
string
y
a
little
c
program
to
read
data
is
in
file
cs130a
files
read
c
october
pm
in
the
project
i
say
that
when
a
arraytrienode
or
a
linkedtrienode
has
a
count
that
becomes
it
should
become
a
tinytrienode
that
is
incorrect
sorry
about
that
it
becomes
a
tinytrienode
when
in
addition
to
the
count
being
the
strends
is
true
october
pm
the
homeworks
have
been
graded
you
can
pick
them
up
during
my
office
hours
today
from
the
solutions
are
in
the
rbr
they
are
also
in
the
file
cs130a
files
hw1
ps
you
can
print
that
file
or
view
it
with
ghostscript
hw1
ps
the
press
the
left
bottom
on
the
dismiss
sign
if
it
appears
put
the
mouse
insede
the
window
and
type
cr
to
advance
the
page
additional
information
on
ghostview
appears
when
you
type
man
hw1
ps
in
the
hw
it
should
say
that
bogdan
cocosel
is
a
co
author
of
the
solutions
october
pm
oops
i
forgot
to
add
this
but
here
it
is
in
the
file
cs130a
files
proj
c
and
the
file
cs130a
files
projh
c
you
will
find
code
to
access
and
create
the
two
examples
in
the
project
handout
you
can
copy
them
into
your
directory
compile
it
and
run
it
october
am
as
we
say
in
the
project
description
we
are
dealing
with
sets
so
we
do
not
keep
multiple
copies
of
the
same
word
in
the
same
set
also
the
input
is
error
free
but
one
might
try
to
insert
a
word
in
a
set
that
is
already
there
or
delete
a
word
that
is
not
in
a
set
in
the
first
case
you
must
not
insert
the
word
and
the
count
needs
to
remain
unchanged
in
the
second
case
the
count
must
remain
unchanged
and
nothing
must
be
deleted
note
that
this
is
important
to
facilitate
testing
if
you
implement
insert
as
in
the
class
notes
you
will
have
to
make
to
passes
over
the
trie
in
some
cases
either
to
update
the
count
when
inserting
a
new
word
or
unupdating
the
count
if
it
was
updated
incorrectly
because
the
word
was
already
there
you
can
create
a
member
function
whoami
defined
like
getnext
to
return
the
type
of
object
you
have
for
derived
classes
like
tinytrienode
etc
october
pm
remember
that
the
final
type
of
a
node
depends
on
the
number
of
words
in
that
subtree
it
does
not
depend
on
the
number
of
nodes
or
the
number
of
nonnull
pointers
in
that
subtree
october
pm
the
office
hours
of
the

on
wednesday
