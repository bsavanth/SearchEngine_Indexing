reading
for

the
readings
for
this
meeting
are
all
online
on
the
www
the
first
paper
combines
some
degree
of
vision
a
little
with
some
degree
of
technology
nothing
particularly
ambitious
but
a
description
of
the
state
of
the
art
the
second
paper
is
a
non
technical
piece
that
promotes
the
theme
of
learners
taking
responsibility
for
their
education
something
that
will
be
increasingly
important
in
the
future
the
two
choices
for
the
third
reading
are
papers
that
are
more
sophisticated
than
either
of
the
first
two
the
paper
beyond
browsing
elaborates
on
the
possibility
of
group
annotation
of
www
materials
the
paper
the
dec
web
toolkit
describes
in
technical
terms
a
layer
of
internet
infrastructure
that
could
make
it
possible
to
have
smart
distributed
tutorial
applications
that
do
more
than
what
mosaic
or
netscape
can
achieve
