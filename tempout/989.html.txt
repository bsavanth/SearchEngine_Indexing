the

is
to
gain
experience
with
the
major
paradigms
and

used
in
creating
algorithms
and
with
basic
methods
for
analyzing
the

there

not

class
participation

the

late

policy
all
assignments
are
due
at
the
beginning
of
class
in
other
cases
assignments
turned
in
within
hours
will
receive
a
penalty
and
those
turned
in
to
hours
late
will
receive
a
penalty
exception
each
student
may
turn
in
one
homework
assignment
up
to
two
days
late
with
no

regrade
requests
must
be
made
within
one
week
of
when
the
assignments
are
returned
in
class
policy
on
collaboration
homework
and
programming
assignments
should
be
done
alone
it
is
reasonable
to
discuss
general
approaches
to
problem
solution
or
algorithm
design
with
other
students
but
the
bulk
of
the
work
must
be
done
alone
working
out
details
sharing
in
the
write
up
or
sharing
or
copying
code
will
be
treated
as
a
violation
of
the
academic
integrity
