students
it
is
assumed
that
you
have
taken
c211
here
at
indiana
and
so
are
familiar
with
the
scheme
programming
language
the
particular
skills
needed
are
the
ability
to
program
in
a
symbolic
programming
language
and
the
experience
of
programming
with
recursion

we
will
use

course
description
the
mathematical
foundations
of
computer
science
differ
somewhat
from
from
those
of
the
physical
and
social
sciences
the
study
of
computation
has
two
main
branches
performance
and
meaning
in
formalizing
performance
we
focus
on
combinatorics
and
statistics
whose
foundations
are
included
in
traditional
mathemematics
in
formalizing
meaning
we
draw
more
heavily
on
logic
both
as
a
way
to
express
ideas
about
programs
and
as
a
discipline
for
describing
what
computers
are
and
what
they
do
computation
takes
place
in
a
discrete
digital
domain
where
all
phenomena
ultimately
reduce
to
binary
s
and
s
to
explore
this
universe
we
need
different
mathematical
tools
than
are
used
by
physicists
and
chemists
we
use
induction
far
more
often
than
differentiation
or
integration
for
example
and
will
see
numerous
styles
of
inductive
reasoning
in
this
course
we
will
also
explore
discrete
mathematical
structures
trees
and
other
graphs
that
are
prevalent
in
computing
the
main
goal
of
the
course
is
to
improve
each
participant
s
ability
to
conduct
a
rigorous
mathematical
argument
that
is
to
do
proofs
one
reason
not
the
only
one
we
look
at
logic
in
this
course
is
for
the
purpose
of
evaluating
proof
narratives
a
central
idea
of
this
course
is
that
doing
a
proof
and
programming
are
pretty
much
the
same
activities
the
better
you
are
at
proving
the
better
programmer
you
will
be
more
important
the
better
computer
scientist
you
will
become
i
plan
to
follow
the
text
book
except
for
chapters
prolog
specification
in
z
and
relational
database
systems
i
may
have
to
skip
more
chapters
depending
on
our
progress
through
the
material
i
may
also
introduce
some
topics
from
later
chapters
as
we
go
along
there
are
a
few
topics
not
in
the
text
that
we
may
look
at
again
if
there
is
time
in
any
event
i
will
cover
all
the
material
of
a
core
course
syllabus
and
supplementary
material
one
or
two
weeks
will
be
devoted
to
each
of
the
chapters
listed
below
supplementary
material
is
or
will
be
included

the

listing
in
some
cases
this
is
an
evolving

will

permitting
homework
assignments
in
studying
the
textbook
material
you
should
work
enough
exercises
and
problems
in
the
text
to
ensure
that
you
understand
the
material
since
many
of
the
discussions
in
class
will
derive
from
these
exercises
we
should
be
certain
that
at
least
one
individual
has
worked
through
every
one
of
them
so
every
problem
has
assigned
to
it
one
or
two
students
who
are
expected
to
be
able
to
present
the
problem
at
a
class
meeting
these
assignments
are
maintained
in
the
s251
newsgroup
most
homeworks
will
not
be
graded
for
credit
the
purpose
of
these
assignments
is
to
guide
participants
in
preparing
for
the
presentation
of
material
in
the
class
and
to
show
the
kinds
of
problems
that
will
be
asked
on
examinations
challenges
are

assignments

are

you
are
welcome
to
discuss
assignments
presentations
and
challenges
with
other
students
do
not
assume
this
is
true
in
all
your
courses
teamwork
in
doing
assignments
is
good
as
long
as
each
member
of
the
team
contributes
and
fully
understands
the
assignment
if
you
are
working
with
a
group
please
indicate
it
on
your
homework
papers
if
someone
has
given
you
a
lot
of
help
acknowledge
them
you
will
not
be
penalized
and
they
will
get
the
thanks
they
deserve

the

criteria

for
this

class
i
would
like
to
place
greater
emphasis
on
interation
and
participation
than
on
formal
examinations
and
assignments
however
the
form
of
participation
is
something
i
would
like
to
discuss
at
the
first
meeting
of
the
class
also
since
i
am
required
to
enter
a
grade
for
each
participant
at
the
end
of
the
semester
some
objective
performance
comparison
will
be
necessary
for

two

during

during
the
first
three
weeks
students
will
be
asked
to
provide
feedback
on
all
aspects
of
the
course
providing
an
early
opportunity
to
inform
the
instructors
about
how
the
course
should
be
run
final
course
evaluations
are
taken
seriously
by
the
department
and
are
integral
to
yearly
faculty
and
department
evaluations
to
encourage
participation
credit
will
be
given
to
those
students
who
submit
a
full
evaluation
during
the
week
prior
to
final
examinations
the
evaluations
are
anonymous
but
a
transaction
record
is
generated
whenever
an
individual
evaluation
is
updated
these
transaction
records
are
compiled
and
sorted
by
the
undergraduate
secretary
thus
the
instructor
is
informed
about
who
filed
evaluations
independently
of
what
those
evaluations
may
contain

among
other
things
that
the
student
must
