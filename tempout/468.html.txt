atomic
structure
calculations
the
wave
equation
describing
the
structure
of
an
atom
is
a
partial
differential
equation
of
eigenvalue
type
high
performance
architectures
and
efficient
algorithms
are
needed
to
solve
systems
with
three
or
more
electrons
the
atomic
structure
project
is
concerned
with
the
development
of
software
for
the
accurate
determination
of
wave
functions
from
which
a
number
of
atomic
properties
can
be
predicted
of
particular
importance
are
properties
associated
with
energy
transfer
mechanisms
such
as
transition
probabilities
over
the
years
an
atomic
structure
package
has
been
developed
currently
a
parallel
version
has
been
implemented
on
a
network
of
ibm
risc
workstations
using
a
a
sparse
matrix
eigenvalue
solver
