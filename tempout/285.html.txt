morphing
techniques
can
generate
compelling
d
transitions
between
images
however
differences
in
object
pose
or
viewpoint
often
cause
unnatural
distortions
in

that
are
difficult
to
correct

basic

of

geometry
this
paper
introduces
a
simple
extension
to
image
morphing
that
correctly
handles
d
projective
camera
and
scene
transformations
the
technique
called
em
view
morphing
works
by
prewarping
two
images
prior
to
computing
a
morph
and
then
postwarping
the
interpolated
images
because
no
knowledge
of
d
shape
is
required
the
technique
may
be
applied
to
photographs
and
drawings
as
well
as
rendered
scenes
the
ability
to
synthesize
changes
both
in
viewpoint
and
image
structure
affords
a
wide
variety
of
interesting
