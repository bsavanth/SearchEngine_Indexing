description
multimedia
systems
are
characterized
by
use
of
several
different
methods
of
presenting
data
such
as
voice
motion
video
music
and
text
a
conference
call
between
several
parties
that
use
both
voice
and
video
and
a
playback
of
a
recorded
conversation
are
two
examples
of
multimedia
applications
each
type
of
multimedia
data
has
different
properties
for
example
the
bandwidth
required
for
cd
quality
audio
is
very
different
from
that
required
for
full
motion
video
which
is
different
from
that
of
plain
text
however
a
property
common
to
all
of
these
data
types
is
that
they
are
all
real
time
in
nature
the
applications
send
stream
of
data
that
must
be
used
within
a
time
interval
because
the
data
is
useless
after
that
interval
optimal
scheduling
of
real
time
tasks
on
distributed
and
multiprocessor
systems
is
an
essential
issue
for
multimedia
applications
the
objective
of
this
seminar
is
to
study
the
basic
properties
and
techniques
for
real
time
system
support
for
multimedia
application
we
will
study
and
present
research
papers
in
this
area
topics
include
real
time
scheduling
causal
message
ordering
multiprocessor
real
