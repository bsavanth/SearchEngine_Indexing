course
overview
this
is
a
basic
course
on
the
design
and
analysis
of
algorithms
the
course
will
focus
on
both
general
classes
of
algorithms
such
as
dynamic
programming
divide
and
conquer
and
greedy
methods
and
advanced
data
structures
such
as
balanced
trees
graphs
and
heaps
in
addition
we
will
compare
different
algorithms
formally
by
analyzing
their
complexity
i
e
running
time
the
problems
we
will
study
involve
sorting
searching
graph
algorithms
computational
geometry
and
a
sprinkling
of
other
topics
which
vary
from
year
to
year
prerequisites
the
official
prerequisite
for
this
course
is
cs109ab
introduction
to
computer
science
or
equivalent
although
this
course
will
be
entirely
a
pen
and
paper
course
i
e
no
programming
familiarity
with
programming
concepts
such
as
pointers
arrays
records
procedures
and
recursion
will
be
assumed
in
addition
a
solid
background
in
mathematics
will
prove
invaluable
for
this
course
in
that
we
will
argue
formally
about
the
correctness
and
performance
of
almost
every
algorithm
and
data
structure
introduced
the
ability
to
write
clear
formal
and
brief
proofs
will
be
relied
upon
