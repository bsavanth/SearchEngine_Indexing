problem
solving
exercises
one
of
the
most
important
skills
you
will
learn
in
this
class
is
problem
solving
good
problem
solving
skills
distinguish
a
good
computer
programmer
from
a
bad
one
it
doesn
t
matter
how
familiar
or
skilled
you
are
in
a
particular
programming
language
if
you
do
not
understand
how
to
solve
the
problem
then
you
will
not
be
able
to
write
a
computer
program
for
it
in
any
language
to
help
you
learn
problem
solving
skills
and
techniques
i
will
assign
weekly
problem
solving
exercises
these
will
be
small
but
non
trivial
problems
which
i
will
give
out
each
monday
you
should
look
at
the
problem
and
think
about
it
during
the
week
and
right
down
the
steps
you
would
go
through
to
solve
the
problem
i
e
the
overall
structure
of
your
program
this
is
primarily
an
exercise
in
general
problem
solving
so
you
do
not
have
to
write
any
fortran
code
though
you
may
if
you
want
to
and
have
time
and
your
solution
algorithm
should
not
even
be
dependent
on
a
particular
programming
language
such
as
fortran
each
friday
we
will
