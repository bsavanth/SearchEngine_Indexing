architectural
features
of
single
chip
dsp
processors
will
be
introduced
in
lecture
specifically
the
arithmetic
memory
organization
pipelining
strategies
and
the
use
of
special
on
chip
hardware
e
g
multipliers
barrel
shifters
will
be
emphasized
illustrative
examples
will
be
given
using
representative
dsp
processors
such
as
the

etc
laboratory
experiments
using
both
the

will
incluse

implementations
and
a
twelve

project
of
the
student
s
choice
the
laboratory
will
also
introduce
the
students
to
the
state
of
the
art
equipment
for
dsp
design
and
verification
specifically
the
tektronix
analyzer
and
the
dsp
technology
siglabs
are
versatile
multi

frequency
instruments
capable
of
spectrum
network
and
transient
analysis
of
real

dsp
systems
working
in
the
audio
frequency
range
in
the
remainder
of
this

we
provide
an

final
project
laboratory
the
structured
laboratory
segment
will
count
for
of
the
total
grade
based
on
participation
and
successful
completion
of
the
weekly
exercises
each
group
will
be
asked
some
general
questions
on
each
experiment
the
intent
is
to
examine
the
students
understanding
of
the
current
experiment
and
if
they
have
developed
an
adequate
understanding
of
the
assembly
code
lab
reports
a
report
on
each
experiment
is
required
by
each
group
of
two
students
the
lab
reports
will
count
for
of
the
total
grade
these
reports
should
contain
a
title
page
with
a
brief
summary
an
introduction
a
description
of
the
experimental
setup
a
results
section
and
a
discussion
and
conclusion
section
the
reports
need
not
be
lengthy
and
need
not
be
typed
however
try
to
be
complete
and
professional
in
your
presentation
exams
the
midterm
exam
will
cover
fundamental
topics
introduced
in
lecture
and
experiments
the
exam
will
be
open
book
notes
and
lab
reports
final
project
you
will
be
given
a
list
of
suggested
project
topics
by
the
end
of
the
second
week
of
class
the
projects
emphasize
real
time
dsp
applications
in
for
example
speech
music
medical
etc
the
project
will
typically
be
a
design
of
a
software
or
hardware
algorithm
for
a
real
time
dsp
system
you
are
encouraged
to
form
teams
of
to
students
for
each
project
with
a
balanced
distribution
of
sw
hw
design
skills
in
addition
to
the
dsp
algorithm
expertise
smaller
teams
are
also
acceptable
if
the
scope
of
the
project
of
interest
so
demands
or
if
there
are
difficulties
in
forming
larger
teams
each
group
is
required
to
submit
a
one
page
pre
proposal
by
the
end
of
the
fourth
week
of
class
a
form
will
be
provided
for
filling
out
the
pre
proposal
a
final
project
proposal
based
on
the
instructors
feedback
to
the
pre
proposal
will
be
due
by
the
beginning
of
the
sixth
week
of
class
a
task
timeline
should
be
included
in
the
final
project
proposal
a
one
page
progress
report
is
required
from
each
group
weekly
after
the
final
project
report
has
been
approved
you
will
have
free
access
to
the
laboratory
while
you
are
working
on
your
project
however
you
are
expected
to
show
up
during
the
regular
laboratory
time
to
demonstrate
the
current
status
of
your
project
to
the
instructor
or
the
ta
this
will
hopefully
allow
you
to
keep
track
of
your
progress
towards
your
final
goal
successful
completion
of
the
project
is
very
important
however
your
effort
to
solve
unforeseen
problems
and
your
engineering
approach
will
be
rewarded
a
final
project
report
will
be
due
by
the
end
of
the
semester
and
a
technical
presentation
will
be
scheduled
shortly
afterwards
