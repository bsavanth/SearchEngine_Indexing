outline
the
goal
of
this
course
is
tying
various
models
of
computation
machines
grammars
functions
and
languages
understanding
the
relationship
among
them
is
essential
to
any
further
study
of
computer
science
machines
can
be
viewed
as
models
of
computation
we
study
various
types
of
machines
and
their
power
and
limitations
grammars
are
proposed
to
describe
the
languages
accpeted
by
these
machines
finding
the
relationships
and
proving
properties
require
formal
approaches
we
will
also
show
how
these
theories
can
be
applied
in
various
branches
of
computer
science
to
demonstrate
how
the
course
is
applicable
to
other
areas
and
to
enhance
the
understanding
of
materials
programming
