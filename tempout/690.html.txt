here
is
a
new
optional
paper
by
paul
rodriguez
on
context
free
languages
and
simple
recurrent
nets
topics
this
course
provides
an
introduction
to
the
field
of
natural
language
processing
or
computational
linguistics
including
both
analysis
and
generation
speech
processing
machine
translation
and
computational
approaches
to
language
acquisition
and
language
evolution
are
also
given
some
attention
a
wide
range
of
linguistic
phenomena
including
phonology
morphology
syntax
and
semantics
and
pragmatics
will
be
treated
and
examples
will
come
from
various
languages
we
will
be
concerned
both
with
how
well
particular
approaches
solve
practical
problems
and
with
how
well
they
model
human
data
the
course
is
divided
into
two
relatively
separate
components
the
first
deals
with
symbolic
approaches
to
language
processing
we
will
cover
parsing
and
generation
algorithms
emphasizing
modern
unification
based
approaches
but
will
spend
more
of
our
time
considering
the
sorts
of
grammars
that
support
parsing
and
generation
with
respect
to
theory
and
notation
we
will
stick
mainly
with
head
driven
phrase
structure
grammar
probably
the
most
popular
approach
in
computational
linguistics
today
the
second
component
of
the
course
deals
with
statistical
and
connectionist
approaches
to
language
processing
which
despite
their
very
different
origins
and
motivation
share
many
underlying
mechanisms
as
well
as
a
lack
of
built
in
linguistic
knowledge
we
will
emphasize
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
phonological
morphological
syntactic
semantic
temporal
processing
and
the
relation
between
perception
and
the
grammar
lexicon
the
course
schedule
however
will
be
organized
around
topics
rather
than
approaches
thus
we
will
look
at
morphology
approaches
to
parsing
and
semantic
case
for
example
in
each
case
considering
how
both
symbolic
and
connectionist
statistical
approaches
deal
with
the
problem
for
each
topic
we
will
also
look
at
acquisition
as
well
as
processing
coursework
and
prerequisites
students
should
have
some
background
in
ai
such
as
c563
and
be
able
to
program
in
scheme
or
lisp
some
linguistics
background
would
also
be
very
helpful
but
is
not
required
cognitive
science
students
from
outside
of
computer
science
are
encouraged
to
enroll
coursework
includes
project
this
may
be
done
in
collaboration
with
others
in
the
class
it
should
include
a
running
program
though
this
can
be
based
on
existing
software
in
the
case
of
connectionist
models
and
a
report
which
relates
the
work
to
other
work
in
the
area
an
attempt
will
be
made
to
relate
projects
to
each
other
by
constraining
the
type
of
language
that
is
handled

a
simple
story
you
might
want
to
use
for
your
project
exams
there
will
be
two
exams
each
covering
half
of
the
course
you
need
only
take
the
portion
of
each
exam
covering
the
approach
symbolic
or
connectionist
statistical
which
is
not
related
to
your
project

students
will

for
