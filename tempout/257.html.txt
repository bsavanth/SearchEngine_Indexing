description
this
seminar
will
take
a
hands
on
approach
to
examining
the
design
of
current
networked
computing
systems
in
particular
we
will
adopt
as
our
case
study
the
software
system
associated
with
a
world
wide
web
server
the
course
will
consist
of
code
walk
throughs
and
lectures
code
walk
throughs
will
include
at
the
kernel
level
namely
in
linux
the
network
file
system
and
process
scheduling
functions
and
at
the
application
level
one
web
server
apache
lectures
will
cover
research
issues
in
server
design
performance
modeling
and
simulation
techniques
this
seminar
will
be
a
prerequisite
or
corequisite
for
participating
in
the
commonwealth
server
project
which
is
being
led
by
the
instructors
however
any
student
who
is
interested
in
studying
the
implementation
of
a
networked
computer
system
is
invited
to
attend
we
will
be
asking
attendees
to
be
notetakers
for
a
week
as
a
notetaker
your
job
is
to
keep
track
of
the
main
themes
of
the
discussion
and
any
interesting
points
made
by
any
of
the
participants
participation
in
this
seminar
is
by
encouragement
consent
of
one
of
the
instructors
students
taking
this
course
for
credit
will
be
expected
to
complete
a
related
project
chosen
in
consultation
with
one
of
the
instructors
the
project
cannot
serve
also
as
a
master
s
project
however
if
a
two
phase
proposal
is
accepted
by
the
instructor
the
second
phase
can
serve
as
a
ms
project
students
may
form
teams
to
work
on
projects
however
the
project
scope
must
scale
linearly
with
the
team
size
and
work
must
be
explicitly
load
balanced
in
a
fair
way
it
s
also
ok
to
take
this
course
for
no
credit
but
to
use
it
to
lead
on
to
an
ms
project
during
a
subsequent
semester
we
will
schedule
a
brownbag
or
two
at
the
end
of
the
semester
each
student
participating
will
be
asked
to
talk
for
a
short
time
mins
on
their
project
or
on
a
related
topic
