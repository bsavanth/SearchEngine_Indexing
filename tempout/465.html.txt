advanced

fall
as
computer
architectures
become
more
complex
having
good
optimizing
compilers
becomes
more
critical
this
course
is
designed
to
study
the
important
components
of
such
optimizing
compilers
the
major
areas
covered
include
intermediate
representations
flow
analysis
and
optimization
alias
analysis
techniques
register
allocation
instruction
scheduling
methods
for
parallelization
and
techniques
for
improving
cache
performance
the
course
will
provide
a
background
for
those
students
interested
in
further
work
in
areas
such
as
compiler
design
flow
analysis
optimization
techniques
parallelizing
compilers
and
computer
architecture
the
course
will
consist
of
lectures
