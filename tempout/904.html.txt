retic
a
behavioral
controller
based
on
the
vertebrate
reticulate
formation
description
the
retic
behavioral
controller
was
proposed
in
by
kilmer
mccullough
and
blum
then
forgotten
for
more
than
years
this
is
all
the
more
amazing
because
the
original
retic
anticipated
work
in
analog
neural
nets
boltzmann
machines
neuroethology
of
behavior
sensor
fusion
and
the
control
of
android
robots
work
done
by
many
of
today
s
researchers
artificial
neural
field
networks
anfns
proposed
by
mills
are
ideally
suited
to
implement
a
vlsi
retic
because
they
model
the
larger
structure
of
the
reticulate
formation
