the
recent
explosion
of
interest
in
the
world
wide
web
has
resulted
in
an
evolving
set
of
protocols
for
using
it
these
protocols
address
the
traditional
concerns
of
operating
systems
interprocess
communication
resource
allocation
security
etc
but
do
so
in
the
more
general
context
of
the
internet
the
goal
of
this
class
is
to
provide
an
understanding
of
the
current
state
of
the
art
in
web
operating
systems
and
also
to
address
problems
that
must
be
solved
to
provide
a
mature
general
purpose
web
operating
system
a
key
hypothesis
behind
the
design
of
this
class
is
that
many
of
the
issues
now
being
addressed
in
the
context
of
the
web
also
have
been
addressed
in
other
more
traditional
areas
of
operating
systems
we
will
occasionally
read
non
web
related
papers
that
may
have
some
bearing
on
understanding
current

problems
