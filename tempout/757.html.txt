time
was
used
to
measure
the
running
time
since
the
order
of
tuples
and
attributes
in
each
tuple
may
be
different
from
one
output
to
another
i
wrote
a
perl
script
to
transform
different
outputs
into
the
same
order
so
that
i
can
compare
usr
bin
diff
them
it
turns
out
that
programs
passed
the
benchmark
without
any
error
other
programs
failed
to
pass
for
some
reasons
you
can
test
it
by
yourself
here
