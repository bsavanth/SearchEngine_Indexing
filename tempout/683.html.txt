group

remember
the
group
projects
will
count
for
of
your
grade
and
will
be
due
on
december
th
for
those
of
you
doing
data
analysis
on
a
pc
i
suggest
you
consider
using
the
goldwave
digital
audio
editor
this
is
a
shareware
package
that
can
be
found
on
the
caen
pentium
machines
in
the
media
union
the
program
is
located
on
the
s
drive
in
the
bin
goldwave
directory
goldwave
does
not
replace
matlab
for
doing
fourier
analysis
filtering
lpc
modelling
etc
but
it
is
a
good
tool
for
manipulation
of
audio
at
the
sample
level
and
performing
simple
transformations
such
as
volume
adjustments
most
importantly
goldwave
is
an
excellent
tool
for
performing
conversions
between
audio
formats
and
extracting
short
segments
of
your
waveforms
for
input
to
matlab
goldwave
will
for
example
convert
wav
files
to
from
matlab
format
if
you
d
like
some
data
to
play
with
and
don
t
have
any
of
your
own
yet
here
are
sample
files
that
you
can
use
they
are
recordings
of
prof
wakefield
s
voice
pronouncing
vowels
as
heard
in
class
use
your
browser
s
save
link
as
feature
to
save
these
to
a
file
in
your
account
shift
left
click
instead
of
just
left
click
if
you
are
using
netscape
note
these
sounds
are
currently
corrupted
due
to
a
bad
file
transfer
i
will
have
fixed
versions
of
these
sounds
available
asap
the
gwvowel
raw
file
is
in
raw
i
e
headerless
bit
signed
monophonic
format
this
file
was
created
on
a
pc
so
it
is
in
little
endian
format
meaning
the
least
significant
bits
of
each
bit
sample
comes
first
in
the
file
if
you
want
to
do
your
experiments
on
a
big
endian
machine
such
as
a
sun
or
hp
you
should
use
this
file
gwbsw
raw
which
is
the
same
data
but
it
has
already
been
byte
swapped
for
you
if
you
use
the
wrong
file
there
ll
be
no
doubt
about
it
when
you
play
it
over
speakers
or
headphones
matlab
code
here
is
some
matlab
code
that
may
be
of
use
or
of
interest
you
can
get
the
code
by
clicking
on
each
link
copying
the
code
and
pasting
it
into
an
editor
window
easier
is
to
use
your
browser
s
save
link
as
function
to
save
the
code
to
a
file
using
netscape
on
a
unix
workstation
right
click
on
the
link
and
select
save
link
as
or
shift
left
click
to
achieve
the
same
thing
please
do
not
print
out
this
code
remember
how
uptight
caen
is
about
printing
things
out
too
many
people
printing

is

any

we
can
use

so
that
the

digital

u
n
exhibits
no

domain
aliasing
realizing
that
the
answer
to
the
above
question
is
no
now
consider
the

u

what
does
this
signal
look
like
for
any
sampling
rate
how
can
this
be
explained
show

an

consider

f

for
n
in

and
the

f
is

now
define

n
in

what
is
the

of

it
is
possible
to
answer
all
of
the
above
questions
without
a
computer
and
without
doing
any
math
having
done
so
repeat
this
exercise
using
matlab
display
the
magnitude
of
your
dft
s
on
a
logarithmic
scale
to
see
the
difference
between
theory
and
reality
also
do
it
again
using
f
think
about
what
you
d
expect
to
see
both
for
the

dft
and
the

let
bk
be
one
set
of
basis
vectors
for
n
point
sequences
let
vk
be
another
set
of
basis
vectors
for
the
same
space
find
the
change
of
basis
transformation
that
is
find
a
matrix
t
such
that
h
y
t
x
transforms
the
vector
of

coefficients
x
expanded
on
the
bk
vectors
to
the
vector
of
expansion
coefficients
y
expanded
on
the
vk
vectors
as
its
name
implies
this
transformation
maps
a
data
vector
from
one
basis
to
another
both
x
and
y
represent
the
same
data
vector
but
written
in
terms
of
different
bases
what
s
the
change
of
basis
transformation
for
mapping
a
fourier
expansion
onto
a
hadamard
expansion

note
if
you
can
do

then
you
are

mentally
speaking

consider

matrices
a

for
an

of
a

show
that

multiplication
is
also
a
circulant
matrix
show
that
ab
ba
is
this
true
in

i
e
for
any
matrix
why
are
the
above
properties
important
when

prove
