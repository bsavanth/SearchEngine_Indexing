prerequisites
in
computer
science
students
should
have
taken
at
least
pomona
cs
or
hmc
cs
a
background
of
several
upper
division
courses
particularly
algorithms
would
be
helpful
but
is
not
absolutely
necessary
in
mathematics
students
should
have
taken
at
least
one
course
which
contains
formal
definitions
theorems
and
proofs
linear
algebra
is
usually
such
a
course
there
will
be
some
basic
number
theory
that
will
be
covered
along
the
way
so
students
should
be
comfortable
reading
understanding
and
discussing
mathematical
topics
materials
there
is
no
textbook
to
purchase
we
will
be
using
books
and
journal
articles
from
the
libraries
and
resources
from
the
web
some
of
these
will
be
mentioned
in
class
others
will
be
discovered
by
members
of
the
class
expect
to
spend
some
time
in
the
library
and
see
the
note
below
on
the
bibliography
project
topics
the
seminar
is
about
systems
for
encryption
and
authentication
with
an
emphasis
on
mathematical
foundations
and
algorithms
although
implementations
social
issues
and
legal
questions
are
important
they
are
of
secondary
interest
the
specific
topics
will
depend
on
the
interests
of
the
participants
and
the
available
resources
requirements
and
grading
each
student
will
carry
out
a
research
project
during
the
semester
we
will
discuss
possible
topics
by
the
third
or
fourth
week
of
the
semester
a
proposal
with
a
topic
and
a
list
of
possible
sources
is
due
on
march
a
paper
of
approximately
ten
pages
is
due
on
april
the
seminar
will
consist
primarily
of
student
presentations
and
discussion
each
student
will
make
two
to
four
presentations
one
of
which
will
be
a
report
on
the
student
s
project
grades
will
be
determined
by
the
