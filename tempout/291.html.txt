format
in
this
class
i
will
be
presenting
some
of
the
fundmental
topics
that
form
the
basis
of
research
in
distributed
systems
the
topics
we
will
cover
are
in
no
way
exhaustive
and
of
course
they
reflect
my
own
subjective
biases
i
will
be
using
tanenbaum
s
textbook
as
well
as
a
short
collection
of
papers
this
combination
should
help
expose
you
to
both
some
practical
and
well
as
theoretical
aspect
of
distributed
systems
i
expect
you
all
to
read
the
chapters
and
papers
that
i
discuss
in
class
i
strongly
encourage
you
to
come
and
talk
to
me
about
any
distributed
systems
topics
that
are
not
covered
in
this
list
i
expect
to
hand
out
homework
assignments
some
of
these
will
involve
programming
some
of
the
basic
ideas
discussed
in
class
some
of
the
homeworks
may
involve
reading
a
paper
that
is
related
to
the
topic
being
discussed
in
class
i
have
put
several
books
on
reserve
in
the
library
some
of
which
may
provide
some
background
material
while
others
complement
the
class
