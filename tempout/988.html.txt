aim
of
the
course
we
will
provide
introductions
to
propositional
predicate
and
modal
logics
these
will
be
studied
and
used
throughout
the
course
as
tools
for
the
specification
and
verification
of
properties
of
programs
and
protocols
topics
first
order
logic
propositional
logic
predicate
logic
completeness
and
compactness
theorems
semantics
via
quantifier
games
g
del
s
incompleteness
theorem
modal
logic
temporal
logic
and
logics
of
knowledge
axiomitization
semantics
via
kripke
structures
applications
these
may
change
slightly
according
to
the
background
and
interests
of
the
students
evolving
algebras
due
to
gurevich
et
al
this
offers
an
operatonal
semantics
for
programming
languages
and
protocols
via
finite
logical
structures
temporal
logic
of
actions
lamport
s
system
of
specification
and
verification
via
temporal
logic
distributed
protocols
we
will
use
logics
of
knowledge
to
express
correctness
and
security
of
distributed
protocols
model

using
temporal
logic
to
verify
properties
of

using

to

requirements
students
will
be
expected
to
participate
in
class
there
will
be
three
problem
sets
concerning
the
introductory
material
on
first
order
and
modal
logic
each
student
will
choose
a
more
advanced
topic
to
study
in
detail
he
or
she
will
write
a
short
paper
and
give
a
lecture
on
this
topic
texts
for
first
order
logic
we
will
follow

this
is
available
at
the
jeffery
amherst
college
store
in
downtown
amherst
for
the
rest
of
the
course
we
will
follow
selected
research
papers
prerequisites
sufficient
mathematical
sophistication
if
you
are
unsure
whether
you
have
it
try
looking
at

due
we
have
finished
propositional
logic
and
begun
predicate
logic
see
notes
sept
on
wednesday
oct
i
proved
the
completeness
theorem
and
the
compactness
theorem
for
predicate
logic
you
should
have
read
van
dalen
through
page
note
that
in
this
course
we
are
only
interested
in
the
countable
case
so
you
do
not
need
to
worry
about
larger
cardinalities
nor
do
you
have
to
remember
zorn
s
lemma
on
monday
oct
i
introduced
ehrenfeucht
fraisse
games
these
are
the
best
and
most
pleasant
way
to
figure
out
what
can
and
cannot
be
expressed
in
first
order
logics
by
then
you
should
have
read
the
handout
pebble
games
from
my
forthcoming
book
descriptive
complexity
on
wednesday
oct
i
finished
the
introduction
to
predicate
logic
by
now
please
skim
the
rest
of
chapter
of
van
dalen
topics
that
you
should
pay
particular
attention
to
are
substructures
isomorphism
elementary
equivalence
and
skolemization
second
problem
set
due
oct
on
oct
i
introduced
evolving
algebra
please
read
the
evolving
algebra
tutorial
and
the

on

i
concluded
my
presentation
of
evolving
algebras
using
the
paper
why
use
evolving

for
hardware
and
software
engineering
by

also
available
on
the
evolving

i
also
talked
briefly
about
denotational
semantics
using

i
t
press
chapter
by
way
of
comparison
on
oct
and
i
will
give
a
three
lecture
introduction
to
modal
logics
emphasizing
temporal
logic
and
logics
of
knowledge
please
read
the
article
by
vardi
why
is
modal
logic
so
robustly
decidable
which
i
handed
out
i
will
also
use
some
material
from
the
book
by
fagin
halpern
moses
and
vardi
reasoning
about
knowledge
m
i
t
press
on
monday
nov
i
will
talk
about
about
an
interesting
paper
that
uses
logic
of
knowledge
to
discuss
security
in
distributed
systems
a
logic
of
authentication
by
burrows
abadi
and
needham
please
read
this
paper
before
the
class
on
wednesday
nov
through
monday
nov
i
will
talk
about
lamport
s
temporal
logic
of
actions
you
might
want
to
look

has
many
pointers
to
work
going
on
