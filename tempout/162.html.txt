hours
tuth
pm
or
by
appointment
goals
introduce
and
study
the
philosophy
utility
and
models
of
connectionist
computing
such
that
students
are
able
to
propose
original
research
with
potential
follow
up
in
a
graduate
research
program
expand
the
creativity
of
the
students
in
all
aspects
of
computing

you
will

these
may
be

when
available
but
the
researching
graduate
students
have
priority
on
these
machines
software
for
simulations
projects
etc
will
be
made
available
literature
i
have
placed
interesting
and
representative
papers
for
reference
in
the
periodicals
room
of
the
hbll
library
there
are
two
separate
packets
copies
of
the
first
and
both
are
under
my
name
as
needed
i
will
place
more
packets
in
the
library
i
also
have
more
papers
in
my
office
which
can
be
looked
over
and
copied
under
constraint
of
the
minute
rule
i
can
also
send
for
most
any
paper
you
wish
through
interlibrary
loan
and
will
do
so
but
it
usually
takes
weeks
so
plan
ahead

am
grading
is
on
a
curve
and
some
amount
of
subjectivity
is
allowed
for
attendance
participation
perceived
effort
etc
if
you
think
you
ll
be
all
right
late
assignments
assignments
are
expected
on
time
beginning
of
class
on
due
date
late
papers
will
be
marked
off
at
school
day
late
however
if
you
have
any
unusual
circumstances
sick
out
of
town
unique
from
what
all
the
other
students
have
etc
which
you
inform
me
of
then
i
will
not
take
off
any
late
points
nothing
will
be
accepted
after
the
last
day
of
class
instruction
project
an
indepth
effort
on
a
particular
aspect
of
neural
networks
a
relatively
extensive
literature
search
in
the
area
is
expected
with
a
subsequent
bibliography
good
projects
are
typically
as
follows
best
some
of
your
own
original
thinking
and
proposal
of
a
network
learning
paradigm
system
etc
this
and
other
projects
are
typically
well
benefited
by
some
computer
simulation
to
bear
out
potential
very
good
starting
from
an
indepth
study
of
some
current
model
strive
to
extend
it
through
some
new
mechanisms
not
bad
a
study
of
a
current
model
with
an
indepth
analysis
of
its
strengths
weaknesses
potential
and
suggested
research
not
good
a
description
of
a
current
model
the
earlier
you
start
the
better
note
that
in
a
semester
course
like
this
you
will
have
to
choose
a
topic
when
we
have
only
covered
half
of
the
material
that
does
not
mean
your
project
must
cover
items
related
to
the
first
half
of
the
semester
you
should
use
your
own
initiative
and
the
resources
available
library
literature
texts
me
etc
to
peruse
and
find
any
topic
of
interest
to
you
regardless
of
whether
we
have
or
will
cover
it
in
class
interesting
models
which
we
will
probably
not
have
