groups
problems
into
classes
according
to
how
much
of
particular
computational
resources
their
solutions
require
familiar
examples
are
p
and
np
which
are
classes
of
problems
solvable
with
at
most
polynomial
time
with
and
without
nondeterminism
we
will
investigate
what
is
known
about
common
complexity
classes
which
capture
such
ideas
as
feasibility
randomized
algorithms
boolean
circuits
parallel
computation
and
interactive
proofs
along
the
way
we
will
learn
some
of
the
major
recent
results
in
this
area
some
of
which
were
even
reported
in
the
new

objectives
to
understand
the
approach
toward
classifying
computational
problems
taken
by
structural
complexity
define
a
class
of
problems
according
to
computational
resources
required
to
solve
them
and
investigate
the
relationships
between
these
classes
to
understand
the
proof
techniques
used
to
characterize
the
inherent

of
problems
in
