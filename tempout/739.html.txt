the
softbot
was
one
of
the
finalists
in
the
discover
awards
for
technological
innovation
in
computer
software
building
autonomous
agents
that
interact
with
real
world
software
environments
such
as
operating
systems
or
databases
is
a
pragmatically
convenient
yet
intellectually
challenging
substrate
for
ai
research
to
support
this
claim
we
are
utilizing
planning
and
machine
learning
techniques
to
develop
an
internet
softbot
software
robot
a
customizable
and
moderately
intelligent
assistant
for
internet
access
the
softbot
accepts
goals
in
a
high
level
language
generates
and
executes
plans
to
achieve
these
goals
and
learns
from
its
experience
the
softbot
enables
a
human
user
to
state
what
he
or
she
wants
accomplished
the
softbot
disambiguates
the
request
and
dynamically
determines
how
and
where
to
satisfy
it
the
softbot
uses
a
unix
shell
and
the
world
wide
web
to
interact
with
a
wide
range
of
internet
resources
