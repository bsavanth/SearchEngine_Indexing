this
seminar
will
explore
the
user
interface
database
boundary
especially
in
the
context
of
multimedia
systems
the
goal
is
an
architecture
where
these
separate
components
share
more
by
way
of
common
concepts
and
structures
and
less
through
procedural
interfaces
the
intention
here
is
to
conceptualize
and
implement
multimedia
objects
having
semantically
relevant
structure
amenable
to
querying
and
manipulation
in
contrast
to
current
multimedia
systems
which
lack
the
database
perspective
of
data
independence
and
associated
query
capabilities
and
to
current
databases
which
treat
multimedia
objects
as
blobs
if
at
all
the
seminar
will
develop
prototype
implementations
which
present
diverse
information
such
as
movies
sound
tracks
and
even
traditional
relational
data
within
a
unified
conceptual
framework
and
presentation
environment
this
implementation
will
be
done
by
teams
who
bring
a
variety
of
experiences
to
bear
on
the
multifaceted
issues
which
will
arise

structured
documents
as
multimedia
databases
documents
have
been
a
big
source
of
information
for
almost
all
of
the
history
of
human
civilization
however
until
recently
information
in
documents
was
not
being
used
propoerly
because
of
poor
structuring
of
documents
introduceion
to
structured
documents
using
tags
or
markups
have
majorly
changed
this
situation
and
tagged
electronic
texts
are
becoming
more

more
widespread

as

goldfarb
charles
have
been
introduced
for
creating
structured
documents
but
extracting
the
information
based
on
the
structures
in
the
documents
is
still
not
a
very
simple
issue
and
in
most
cases
it
is
ad
hoc
and
based
on
primitive
word
searches
this
talk
would
introduce
structured
documents
and
sgml
and
discuss
some
of
the
ways
of
extracting
information
out
of
tagged
documents
in
particular
some
present
directions
toward
this
area
would
be
discussed
along
with
examples
advantages

using

into

database
for
which
a

engine
is
available
however
since
the

are
not
marked
up

large
information
spaces
present
several
problems
for
visualization
such
spaces
require
tools
that
visualize
all
the
necessary
data
and
facilitate
comprehension
of
global
structure
most
traditional
tools
provide
a
simple
window
that
displays
a
limited
extent
of
data
this
is
problematic
because
not
all
the
data
is
concurrently
visible
navigation
through
the

is

first
identify

here
are
