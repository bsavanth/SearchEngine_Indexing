this

covers
the
fundamentals
of
recursive
function
theory
and
the
theory
of
computational
complexity
that
is
we
examine
the
inherent
limitations
of
computation
both
theoretical
and
practical

some
properties
of

from
these

such
as
inherent

i
will

to
be
sure
that
you
are
making
a
good
faith
effort
but
will
not

it
hence
it
does
not
contribute
to

you
will
understand

if
you
