chaotic
people
all
sorts
of
people
work
on
the
chaotic
routing
project
research
papers
and
technical
reports
a
repository
of
all
of
the
research
papers

chaos
router
chip
the
chaos
router
chip
is
an
implementation
of
the
chaos
routing
algorithm
in
hardware
it
has
been
built
and
tested
in
micron
cmos
and
redesigned
in
a
micron
process
for
better
performance
simulator
the
chaos
router
simulator
is
a
powerful
simulator
which
can
simulate
all
sorts
of
networks
and
routing
algorithms
it
includes
a
very
nice
graphical
front
end
standards
for
presentation
of
results
at
pcrcw
we
discussed
the
presentation
of
simulation
results
for
routing
algorithms
we
were
able
to
come
up
with
some
guidelines
for
presentation
of
results
other
research
groups
we
re
building
a
list
of
all
research
groups
that
have
webs
describing
research
in
routing
and
or
interconnection
networks
