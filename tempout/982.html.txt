computer
architecture
is
the
science
and
art
of
selecting
and
interconnecting
hardware
components
to
create
a
computer
that
meets
functional
performance
and
cost
goals
this
course
qualitatively
and
quantitatively
examines
computer
design
tradeoffs
we
will
learn
for
example
how
uniprocessors
execute
many
instructions
concurrently
and
why
state
of
the
art
memory
systems
are
nearly
as
complex
as
processors
examining
tradeoffs
requires
that
you
already
know
how
to
design
a
correct
computer
as
is
taught
is
the
important
prerequisite
cs
ece
cs
is
also
a
prerequisite
but
it
is
less
important
and
may
be
taken
concurrently

project
the
default
project
is
to
do
some
original
research
in
a
group
of
three
students
for
example
you
could
examine
a
modest
extension
to
a
paper
studied
in
class
or
simply
re
validate
the
data
in
some
paper
by
writing
your
own
simulator
alternatively
you
may
work
in
a
group
of
two
to
write
a
paper
that
surveys
an
area
within
computer
architecture
projects
will
include
an
oral
presentation
and
a
paper
assignment
examinations
there
will
be
two
midterm
exams
but
no
final
exam
the
midterms
are
listed
in
in
the
approximate
outline
please
advise
me
of
any
conflicts
with
these
likely
exam
times
before
the
end
of
the
second
week
of
classes
homework
there
will
be
several
assignments
many
assignments
will
require
the
review
of
material
that
is
touched
upon
but
not
covered
in
depth
in
class
assignments
will
not
be
weighted
equally
the
approximate
weights
of
each
assignment
will
be
specified
when
the
assignment
is
handed
out
assignments
will
be
due
in
class
on
the
due
date
no
late
assignments
will
be
accepted
except
under
extreme
non
academic
circumstances
discussed
with
the
instructor
at
least
one
week
before
the
assignment
is
due
homework
do
not
turn
in
but
you
may
optionally
do
it
