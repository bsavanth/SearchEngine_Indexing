the
art

nd
ed
mit
press
course
overview
the
goal
of
logic
programming
is
to
allow
us
to
specify
what
properties
a
correct
solution
to
a
problem
must
possess
and
then
automatically
deduce
the
solution
without
further
programming
it
is
a
unique
paradigm
suitable
for
many
non
numeric
applications
and
has
connections
with
a
variety
of
areas
of
computer
science
including
automatic
theorem
proving
deductive
database
and
various
ai
applications
such
as
natural
language
processing
expert
systems
and
knowledge
representation
the
principal
focus
of
this
course
will
be
on
the
semantics
and
pragmatics
of
prolog
programming
and
its
aptness
for
logic
programming
general
background
from
the
formal
prerequisites
c
and
c
will
be
assumed
there
will
be
no
prior
knowledge
of
logic
programming
required
necessary
background
for
course
topics
will
be
developed
it
will
be
assumed
that
the
student
has
experience
with
several
programming
languages
and
especially
that
recursion
is
a
familiar
concept
please
note
that
undergraduate
majors
can
select
this
course
as
one
of
the
two
advanced
cs
courses
required
for
the
b
s
degree
the
course
will
involve
both
conceptual
and
project
work
the
projects
will
be
of
modest
size
and
will
use
prolog
and
possibly
other
logic
languages
for
which
implementations
can
be
obtained
a
tentative
listing
below
indicates
the
range
of
topics
it
will
not
be
possible
to
provide
a
complete
treatment
of
all
these
topics
so
some
will
be
touched
on
