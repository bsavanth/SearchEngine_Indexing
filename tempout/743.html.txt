goals
to
explore
the
notion
of
what
a
programming
language
really
is
to
investigate
programming

programming
the
class
is
not
an
overview
of
a
variety
of
languages
but
a
deep
view
of
programming
paradigms

i
think
it
has
all
the
proper
modifications
to

if
you
have
an
older

you
might
need
to
print

this
is
an
important
paper
on

data
abstraction
and

it
appeared
in

all

scheme
is
a
dynamically

descended
from

several
scheme
manuals
are
available
through
the
web
the
programming
manual
for
scheme
this
is
a
reference
for
the
scheme
language
itself
the
mit

manual
this
describes
the
run

this
describes

in
addition
to
on

manuals
you
might
wish
to
see
these
on

resources
about
scheme
this
site
gives
many
pointers
to
information
about
scheme
and
implementations
of
scheme
there
is
also
a

there
is
even
an
