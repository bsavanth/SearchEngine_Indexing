background
we
will
review
some
advanced
topics
in
artificial
intelligence
planning
reasoning
under
uncertainty
decision
making
vision
robotics
reinforcement
learning
topics
will
be
almost
entirely
disjoint
from
those
of
cps270
so
students
that
have
taken
cps270
are

note
that
curry
guinn
used
the
same
book
in
cps170
last
year
from
what
i
can
tell
the
overlap
between
the
two
courses
after
the
initial
introductory
material
is
quite
small
prerequisites
i
will
assume
that
students
are
familiar
with
programming
any
language
algorithm
analysis
big
o
notation
and
the
like
at
the
level
of
cps130
and
simple
calculus
derivatives
grading
class
grade
will
be
based
on
written
homework
assignments
programming
projects
two
in

exams
and
a
final
exam
outline
i
m
going
to
follow
the

syllabus
in
the
textbook
for
a

course
with
concentration
on
vision
and
robotics

are
