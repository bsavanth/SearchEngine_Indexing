programming
project
in
this
course
we
implement
three
programs
for
the
three
processor
scheduling
problem
one
uses
a
simple
exhaustive
search
another
uses
backtracking
and
the
third
uses
branch
and
bound
for

homework
there
will
be
approximately
eight
homework
assignments
every
two
weeks
however
these
will
be
graded
on
a
pass

basis
where
students
who
turn
in
