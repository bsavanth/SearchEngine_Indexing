this
course
will
cover
several
central
topics
in
the
area
of
databases
these
include
database
modeling
theory
design
and
implementation
of
query
languages
post
relational
database
systems
and
theory
of
transactions
management
it
is
strongly
recommended
that
you
have
had
a
course
which
covers
the
principles
of
database
systems
furthermore
programming
experience
with
c
is
expected
programming
assignments
will
involve
sybase

relational
database
management
system
coral

if
time
permits
we
