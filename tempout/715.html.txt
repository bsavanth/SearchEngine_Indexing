ullman
course
description
the
purpose
of
this
course
is
to
study
advanced
topics
pertaining
to
compiler
construction
since
cs
is
a
prerequisite
to
this
course
a
basic
knowledge
and
understanding
of
compilers
is
assumed
this
course
will
take
a
more
in
depth
look
at
compiler
topics
such
as
various
parsing
techniques
and
grammars
code
optimization
error
recovery
and
type
checking
grading
final
grades
will
be
determined
from
the
following
midterm
exam
final
exam
programs
papers
programs
all
programs
for
this
course
will
be
written
in
either
c
or
c
you
can
use
any
machine
you
would
like
access
to
the
department
pcs
or
unix
machines
will
be
given
for
those
who
need
and
desire
it
there
will
be
three
programs
assigned
throughout
the
semester
they
will
be
fairly
time
consuming
and
involved
so
it
is
strongly
recommended
that
you
begin
early
on
them
you
will
pass
off
your
assignments
by
running
them
on
input
that
i
give
you
and
turning
in
the
results
if
you
begin
early
on
the
assignments
and
budget
your
time
wisely
you
will
have
enough
time
to
complete
the
assignments
if
you
don
t
you
probably
won
t
finish
since
late
homework
is
such
a
hassle
to
deal
with
you
will
be
penalized
substantially
for
turning
you
work
in
late
the
late
policy
is
a
deduction
the
first
day
late
the
second
day
the
third
day
for
the
fourth
day
for
the
fifth
day
and
no
credit
will
be
given
after
that
time
the
first
program
will
be
to
write
a
lexical
analyzer
generator
for
those
of
you
familiar
with
lex
you
will
essentially
be
writing
a
lex
equivalent
the
second
assignment
will
be
to
write
a
parser
generator
like
yacc
the
third
assignment
will
deal
with
compiler
optimizations
papers
you
will
write
two
papers
this
semester
the
first
will
be
due
feb
and
the
second
will
be
due
march
the
papers
will
be
between
and
pages
in
length
and
must
contain
at
least
bibliographic
references
for
each
paper
you
are
to
take
a
research
topic
in
compiler
construction
describe
the
topic
reference
work
that
has
been
done
in
the
area
and
present
ways
of
improving
previous
work
or
new
ideas
for
solving
the
problem
at
hand
the
purpose
of
the
papers
is
to
familiarize
you
with
current
work
being
done
in
this
field
the
best
way
of
accomplishing
this
is

literature
and
become
familiar
with
journals
conferences
and
people
in
