formats
most
of
the
course
materials
above
are
provided
in
three
formats
html
hypertext
markup
language
html
is
the
document
format
handled
by
www
browsers
in
fact
you
are
currently
looking
viewing
an
html
document
many
of
the
handouts
we
ve
provided
were
originally
latex
documents
that
have
been
converted
to
html
using
latex2html
which
is
why
they
can
be
a
bit
strange
latex
plain
ascii
text
including
formating
commands
simple
things
e
g
assignments
are
generally
quite
legible
in
this
format
for
figures
and
complex
math
stuff
these
are
hard
to
impossible
to
read
