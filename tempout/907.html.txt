computer
architecture
computer
science
is
a
sophomore
level
introduction
to
computer
architecture
the
syllabus
gives
an
overview
according
to
how
i
last
taught
the
course
which
was
in
spring
back
then
we
used
a
set
of
lecture
notes
for
the
course
which
are
collected
into
a
camera
ready
pre
book
form
all
of
the
problems
and
solutions
are
given
the
course
notes
are
reproduced
at
the
beginning
of
each
semester
and
are
available
from
the
reprographics
service
in
the
busch
campus
center
for
about
you
can
take
a
peek
at
the
first
few
chapters
which
have
been
placed
on
line
the
postscript
version
is
also
accessible
from
the
on
line
version
in
case
is
too
rough
on
your
book
budget
but
don
t
go
printing
the
whole
pages
on
our
rutgers
printers
beware
that
a
different
hardcover
textbook
was
used
in
the
summer
session
and
fall
and
that
i
may
use
that
textbook
when
i
lecture
the
course
again
my
current
plan
is
to
use
the
lecture
notes
as
a
supplement
to
the
textbook
though
you
would
not
be
expected
to
buy
the
whole
stack
we
would
probably
distribute
portions
free
of
charge
in
that
case
online
unix
documentation
for
rutgers
systems
we
will
use
the
rutgers
computing
facilities
for
some
of
the
coursework
have
a
look
at
the
on
line
documentation
for
how
to
use
our
facilities
