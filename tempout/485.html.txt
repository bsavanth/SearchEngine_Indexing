group

the
department
of
computer

at
the
university
of
massachusetts
unlike
traditional
data
networks
future
broadband
isdn
bisdn
wide
area
networks
will
be
required
to
carry
a
broad
range
of
traffic
classes
ranging
from
bursty
variable
rate
sources
such
as
voice
and
variable
rate
coded
video
to
smooth
constant
bit
rate
sources
moreover
these
networks
will
have
to
do
so
while
providing
a
guaranteed
performance
or
quality
of
service
qos
to
these
traffic
classes
the
problem
of
characterizing
performance
in
such
networks
is
thus
particularly
important
since
this
must
be
done
not
only
for
the
traditional
off
line
tasks
of
dimensioning
and
design
e
g
determining
link
bandwidths
buffer
capacities
and
processing
capacities
at
network
switchpoints
but
also
for
on
line
performance
driven
traffic
control
purposes
such
as
session
level
admission
control
in
this
section
we
outline
our
research
aimed
at
providing
the
analytical
tools
and
techniques
for
analyzing
such
networks
and
their
diverse
workloads
and
for
designing
and
characterizing
the
properties
of
scheduling
policies
in
these
networks
traditional
approaches
towards
performance
evaluation
of
communication
networks
are
generally
not
applicable
in
a
high
speed
network
environment
for
a
number
of
reasons
first
the
traffic
in
future
high
speed
networks
is
projected
to
be
bursty
often
processing
complex
correlations
in
the
cell
arrival
processes
simple
markovian
assumptions
such
as
memoryless
inter
arrival
times
are
thus
likely
to
be
invalid
in
such
networks
the
gigabit
rates
of
future
high
speed
networks
also
render
simulation
ineffective
for
systems
of
any
realistic
size
the
very
performance
metric
s
of
interest
in
a
high
speed
network
will
also
be
different
average
delay
will
no
longer
be
the
primary
performance
measure
and
instead
secondary
performance
measures
such
as
probability
of
buffer
overflow
maximum
packet
delay
and
the
tail
of
delay
distributions
must
be
considered
in
this
respect
there
is
evidence
that
even
relatively
sophisticated
performance
models
which
work
well
for
predicting
average
delay
in
the
presence
of
correlated
arrivals
may
be
less
well
suited
for
computing
these
new
performance
measures
of
interest
naga91
we
also
note
that
many
previous
performance
evaluation
techniques
have
been
confined
to
studying
the
performance
of
the
aggregate
traffic
generated
by
a
set
of
identical
sources
at
a
single
multiplexer
in
isolation
in
connection
oriented
high
speed
networks
with
qos
guarantees
it
is
clear
that
performance
must
be
examined
on
a
per
session
basis
and
in
a
network
setting
kuro92
schu92
finally
we
note
that
given
the
potentially
complex
nature
of
network
traffic
it
is
becoming
increasingly
valuable
to
be
able
to
broadly
characterize
properties
such
as
optimality
or
near
optimality
of
network
control
mechanisms
which
hold
over
a
wide
range
of
traffic
models
and
assumptions
thus
far
however
little
work
has
been
reported
on
this
problem
for
traditional
networks
much
less
for
high
speed
networks
given
the
above
considerations
it
is
evident
that
new
performance
evaluation
techniques
will
be
required
for
the
design
and
analysis
future
high
speed
networks
furthermore
given
the
qos
requirements
of
such
emerging
standards
as
atm
these
techniques
will
also
be
needed
for
on
line
performance
driven
traffic
control
purposes
such
as
session
level
admission
control
our
research
in
these
areas
is
aimed
at
addressing
this
need
our
research
divides
broadly
into
four
areas
we
are
developing
a
methodology
for
obtaining
tight
pessimistic
bounds
on
the
per
session
performance
of
a
collection
of
heterogeneous
sessions
within
a
high
speed
network
kuro92
the
metrics
of
interest
are
the
distribution
of
the
packet
delay
and
the
probability
of
buffer
overflow
our
research
is
unique
in
that
we
are
interested
in
computing
provable
performance
bounds
and
in
doing
so
on
a
per
session
basis
in
a
very
general
network
setting
in
which
sessions
may
traverse
a
number
of
hops
this
methodology
is
useful
not
only
for
the
purpose
of
analyzing
session
and
network
level
performance
but
also
as
a
mechanism
to
be
used
for
call
admission
where
performance
qos
guarantees
are
to
be
provided
we
conjecture
that
the
bounds
computed
using
the
above
methodology
may
sometimes
be
too
loose
to
be
of
practical
interest
in
these
cases
it
will
be
of
interest
to
compute
performance
albeit
in
an
approximate
manner
once
again
in
a
network
setting
we
have
thus
also
examined
a
number
of
approximate
approaches
towards
evaluating
the
performance
of
heterogeneous
sessions
within
a
high
speed
network
schu91
naga91
schu92
the
primary
performance
metric
of
interest
is
probability
of
buffer
overflow
our
research
here
is
noteworthy
in
considering
heterogeneous
sources
and
in
doing
so
in
a
network
setting
we
have
developed
a
methodology
for
designing
and
analyzing
the
qualitative
behavior
of
scheduling
policies
this
is
based
on
sample
path
analysis
and
the
theory
of
majorization
tows90
our
focus
is
on
a
wide
class
of
performance
metrics
including
the
average
and
maximum
packet
delay
the
probability
of
buffer
overflow
and
the
length
of
a
buffer
overflow
burst
as
discussed
above
this
work
is
of
particular
interest
and
value
in
that
it
can
characterize
properties
of
scheduling
mechanisms
such
as
their
optimality
or
near
optimality
over
a
wide
range
of
assumptions
thus
obviating
the
need
for
a
potentially
time
consuming
and
or
difficult
case
by
case
performance
analysis
we
are
also
developing
routing
policies
for
high
speed
networks
hwan91
hwan92
given
the
need
to
provide
qos
guarantees
to
admitted
sessions
and
thus
implicitly
reserve
resources
for
on
going
calls
the
routing
problem
in
high
speed
networks
shares
much
more
in
common
with
circuit
switched
routing
algorithms
than
with
routing
in
traditional
data
communication
networks
our
research
in
hwan92
hwan92a
is
aimed
at
exploiting
the
similarities
with
routing
in
traditional
circuit
switched
networks
and
adapting
these
policies
for
the
case
of
high
speed
atm
networks
of
particular
interest
is
the
fact
that
atm
routing
will
be
more
processing
intensive
hwan92
and
will
be
required
to
route
traffic
with
heterogeneous
bandwidth
requirements
