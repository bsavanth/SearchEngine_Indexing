impulse
based
dynamic
simulation
impulse
based
simulation
is
a
new
paradigm
for
the
simulation
of
physical
systems
especially
those
which
are
hard
to
simulate
efficiently
with
traditional
constraint
based
methods
the
key
idea
is
that
all
contact
interactions
between
objects
are
affected
through
collisions
even
a
block
apparently
at
rest
on
a
table
actually
experiences
many
tiny
rapid
collisions
with
the
surface
the
basic
theory
has
been
put
into
practice
with
impulse
a
rigid
body
dynamic
simulator
running
on
hp
and
sgi
platforms
impulse
was
written
in
c
by
brian
mirtich
physical
accuracy
and
computational
efficiency
have
been
and
continue
to
be
important
design
criteria
for
this
evolving
system

accurate

simulation
of
reasonably
complex
systems
is
the
